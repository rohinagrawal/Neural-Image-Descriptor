# Neural-Image-Descriptor
Image captioning is the process by which we can get a textual description of an image.  

model_path = `./models`  
feature_path = `./data/feats.npy`  
captions_path = `./data/results.token`  
vgg_path = `./data/vgg16-20160129.tfmodel`  

### Dataset
Dataset on which model trained is `Flickr30k`, Website : `http://bryanplummer.com/Flickr30kEntities/`  

Clone the Flickr30k Dataset from `https://github.com/BryanPlummer/flickr30k_entities.git`  

# Image Classification
This was a sub project done for understanding the classification of Images in different classes.  
This sub-project is done on `Fashion MNIST` dataset.  
Download Dataset from `https://www.kaggle.com/zalando-research/fashionmnist`.
